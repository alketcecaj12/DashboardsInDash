Data is everywhere. It’s fundamental to your business process. It allows you to make sound, well-informed decisions driven by evidence, not just conjecture. But how should you represent it? The answer depends, especially when you’re working with stakeholders who don’t have a technical background. That’s where Dash comes in. It’s a powerful and easy-to-use data visualization tool that can help you make optimal strategic decisions.

This repo contains code on how to build powerful and attractive data visualizations, how to create plots, style applications, and adding user interactivity to cultivate more responsive, data-driven relationships. The code also shows strategies to help you get the most out of the Dash experience, and shows you how to deploy your Dash apps to the cloud using Heroku.
